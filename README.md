# Overview
Adds new types of grenades to take advantage of CE mechanics:

* Stinger
* Incendiary
* Defensive frag
* Thermobaric
* Pipebomb
* Anti-Tank
* Prometheum bomb

# Stinger
Less-lethal grenade commonly used by urbworld law enforcement and wasteland slave traders to incapacitate groups of unarmored people. Releases tiny rubber balls that cause muscle spasms on impact. Should not be thrown directly under the target, as that can maim or even kill weaker humans.

# Incendiary
Grenade filed with chemfuel used for quick area denial. Sets flammable surfaces on fire in a large radius upon explosion. In the hands of a swift bushranger, a pack of these grenades can easily engulf the whole forest in flames.

# Defensive
A stronger version of the offensive frag grenade. Explodes on impact, releasing a great number of sharp fragments. Such grenade is intended to be thrown from entrenched positions, as the frags might harm an uncovered user

# Thermobaric
Heavy fragless grenade most often used by stormtroopers to clear entrenched positions. Creates a ground-shaking explosion that tears apart unlucky foes. A formidable weapon against both man and machine.

# Pipe bomb
Improvised throwable explosive device. Releases dangerous frags after the explosion. Due to a lack of proper tools and materials, it lacks the raw power of a normal frag grenade. What it lacks in damage, it makes up for in availability and compactness. A weapon of choice for rebels and outlaws.

# Anti-Tank
Old-school anti-tank grenade, consisting of a shaped charge on a stick supported by large stabilizing fins. A direct hit with this grenade will punch through most armor, while a near-miss will do little to no damage. Rarely used by modern armies due to its unwieldiness and slow deployment.

# Prometheum bomb
Heavy prometheum tank repurposed into a throwable bomb with a timed fuse. Once the timer runs out, prometheum gets exposed to oxygen, causing a violent explosion that drenches everything nearby. Capable of turning even the coldest spaceship into a raging, smoking inferno, which made the bomb popular among space pirates.
